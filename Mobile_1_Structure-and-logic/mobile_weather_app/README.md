# mobile_weather_app

In Module01 you are preparing your weather application. This application, along with
all the applications will have to complete until the end of the piscine, must be responsive.
To start, create new project call weatherApp_proj.
Now, you are creating the structure of your application with:
- An AppBar that includes a search Textfield a geolocation button.
- A BottomBar with 3 tabs: “Currently”, “Today” and “Weekly”.
- Each tab has its own content.

The BottomBar:
• Create a BottomBar with 3 tabs.
• Each tab should have a name and an icon (Currently, Today, Weekly).
• You should be able to switch between tabs by clicking on them or by swiping, both
methods should work.
• When you switch tabs, the content of the page should change. For now, you can
display simple text with the name of the tab, not more!
• At the start of the application, the first tab(Currently) should be selected

The TopBar:
• It contains a search textfield.
• It contains a geolocation button.
Both the TextField and the geolocation button should work !
The application should display the text entered in the textfield or the geolocation
depending on which on is used.
Specifically:
• If you enter text in the search textfield, the application should display the tab name
and the entered text in all tabs.
• If you click on the geolocation button, the application should display the tab name
and “Geolocation” in all tabs.
• The search text and the geolocation text should not be displayed at the same
time.The application must always show the last search.

Your application must be responsive.
